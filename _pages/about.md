My research aims at developing sophisticated system which can understand the natural language and take an intelligent decision - more focussed on question answering and machine reading comprehension problem. I am working on to develop the deep learning based solution for multi-lingual (Indian and Europian languages) and Code-Mixed question answering. To better facilitate the end-user services (virtual assistant, medical assistant etc.) a system should be able to understand and take the decision in multilingual and code-mixed environments.
