I am a post-doctoral researcher at [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/), [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/), USA. I completed my PhD from [Indian Institute of Technology Patna](http://iitp.ac.in/), India under [Dr. Asif Ekbal](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~asif/) and [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/).


<p align="justify">
My primary research interests are natural language processing, machine learning, with a focus on multilingual and multimodal artificial intelligence (AI). I seek to build efficient machine learning methods to solve challenging multilingual and multimodal AI problems that are pervasive in real-world application scenarios such as virtual assistants, clinical decision making etc.
