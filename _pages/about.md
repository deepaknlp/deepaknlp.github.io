I am a post-doctoral researcher at [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/), [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/), USA. I finished my PhD from [Indian Institute of Technology Patna](http://iitp.ac.in/), India. I was advised by [Dr. Asif Ekbal](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~asif/) and [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/).

My research aims at developing question answering systems focused biomedical and healthcare domains. In my PhD, I worked on building
sophisticated system which can understand the natural language and take an intelligent decision - more focussed on question answering and machine reading comprehension problem. I worked on developing the deep learning based solution for multi-lingual (Indian and Europian languages) and Code-Mixed question answering.
