I am a 4th-year Ph.D. Student in [Indian Institute of Technology Patna](http://iitp.ac.in/), India. I am advised by [Dr. Asif Ekbal](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~asif/) and [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/).


<p align="justify">
My research aims at developing sophisticated system which can understand the natural language and take an intelligent decision - more focussed on question answering and machine reading comprehension problem. I am working on to develop the deep learning based solution for multi-lingual (Indian and Europian languages) and Code-Mixed question answering. To better facilitate the end-user services (virtual assistant, medical assistant etc.) a system should be able to understand and take the decision in multilingual and code-mixed environments.
