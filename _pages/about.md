I am a Research Scientist at [National Library of Medicine (NLM)](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/), [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/) working on biomedical NLP. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at NLM under the supervision of [Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/researchstaff/DemnerFushmanDina.html). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India, in 2020.

My research interests include multimodal learning, natural language processing, and deep learning with an emphasis on question answering and summarization for clinical decision making and education. I have also worked on question answering and text generation in multilingual and code-mixed settings.
